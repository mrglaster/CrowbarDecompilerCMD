# Building
I currently build via Visual Basic in Visual Studio Communtiy 2017.
I use Debug x86 when debugging and Release x86 when releasing to public.

I tested building in Visual Studio Community 2019 on 15-Apr-2021. All I had to change were the settings from Debug Any CPU and Release Any CPU to Debug x86 and Release x86 at the top in the default toolbars.
